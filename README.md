# code-quiz
What was your motivation?
I created this project as a Challenge in this Coding Bootcamp to assess my knowledge and skill level in HTML, CSS, and most importantly JavaScript. 
This application uses JavaScript to give users a series of questions, determine whether answers are correct/incorrect and allow them to save their highscores.
This application also saves user data and allows it to be displayed on a subsequent screen.
Building this project has helped me to strenghten my understanding of variables, conditional statements, and the different functions that JavaScript contains.
Features include:
A Timer 
Highscore Data Storage
